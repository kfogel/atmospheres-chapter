\abstract{Abstract.}
%This document is intended as a template and guide for the preparation of chapters for the Handbook of Exoplanets, using latex. It complements the `Guidelines for Authors of the Exoplanet Handbook', which are distributed as a separate document. This template was adapted from Springer's template `author.tex' for contributed books, using the style svmult.cls (distributed together with this template). \\ Each chapter should be preceded by an abstract (10--15 lines long) that summarizes the content. The abstract will appear \textit{online} at \url{www.SpringerLink.com} and at ADS and be available with unrestricted access. This allows unregistered users to read the abstract as a teaser for the complete chapter. For the title you are encouraged to follow the tips for Search Engine Optimization given below.}


\section{Introduction }
"Don't you just hate it when you travel 1,200 light years to a planet scientists have assured you is "Earthlike," and you get there, and there's, like, NO ATMOSPHERE?!!" -- Martin BG, Potomac, MD



\section{Techniques} 
In this chapter we will focus on atmosphere characterization using the combined light from the planet and its host star. In contrast to direct imaging, which seeks to mask the stellar flux, the combined approach capitalizes on the star as a constant reference point. Changes in brightness with time are attributed to emission, reflection, or absorption by the planet's atmosphere.

The most widely used of these combined-light techniques is transmission spectroscopy. For this method, the planet is observed in transit as it passes in front of its host. During a transit, the planet blocks a fraction of the stellar flux, roughly equal to the area of the planet relative to the area of the host star, $\delta = R_p^2/R_s^2$). However, planets with atmospheres do not have a single constant radius at all wavelengths. At wavelengths where the atmosphere has high opacity, 


A cousin of the emission spectroscopy technique is reflection spectroscopy.


\section{Bibliography}
References use the `Springer Basic Style'. Examples for different types of works are given in \href{https://meteor.springer.com/exoplanets/?id=435&tab=About&mode=ReadPage&entity=3283}{\ul{Springer's syle sheet (clickable link)}}. 
\noindent Please note the following on the reference-style:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Initials of first and middle names are concatenated without space, e.g Smith, John Francis appears as Smith JF}
\item{Separate authors by commas; \emph{no} ampersands are used.}
\item{If there are {\bf more then 5 authors}, then {\bf list the first 3 and et al.'}}
\item{{\bf Include titles} (possibly shortened ones), {\bf also for journal articles}!  }
\item{Use journal abbreviations at least for these major journals in Astronomy: A\&A, AJ, ApJ, ARAA, MNRAS, PASP, PASJ. }
\item{Abbreviated Journal names do \emph{not} contain periods. Numerous further journals are defined at the begin of this template. }
\item{The references should be sorted in alphabetical order. If there are several works by the same author, use this order: }
\begin{enumerate}
\item All works by the author alone, ordered chronologically by year of publication
\item All works by the author with a coauthor, ordered alphabetically by coauthor
\item All works by the author with several coauthors, ordered chronologically by year of publication.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
The bibliography will receive a final editing by Springer, so you do not need to worry on style issues as long as all required information is given.

For the most common types of works, examples are also given here, whose appearance may be consulted in the reference-section: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]{Journal paper: \citep{2013A&A...550A..67P} Listing the DOI is optional. }
\item[-]{Journal paper, many authors: \citep{almenara09} }
\item[-]{Book: \citep{all73}  }
\item[-]{Book, 3 authors: \citep{giclas+71}  }
\item[-]{Chapter in book: \citep{2015hae..book.1501B}  \emph{Bibtex users, see comment in section on bibtex.} }
\item[-]{Proceedings:  \citep{Boisnard06}  }
\item[-]{PhD thesis: \citep{AlmenaraThesis10}  }
\end{itemize}

\subsection{bibtex}
The use of bibtex is recommended, taking care of the style issues listed previously. Bibex will use the style file 'spbasicHBexo.bst', distributed together with this template. The  .bib file associated to this template, HBexoTemplatebib.bib', was compiled from ADS with minor modifications.\\

$\bullet$ In bibtex entries sourced from ADS (and possibly also from other sources) , we noted that {\bf replacement of @INBOOK with @INPROCEEDINGS} generates a more complete citation that includes book-title and editors; it also avoids some bibtex-warnings.

\section{Cross-References}
Please keep this as the last section. If you are aware of other chapters in the handbook that are closely related to yours, you may indicate the titles of these chapters, but please not more than 10 of them. If uncertain on the exact title, attempt an approximation so that the editors can insert the exact title later. Editors may also add further chapters here. Please indicate one chapter per line as show in example below. {\bf You should delete these instructions in your contribution.}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Other worlds in ancient greek philosophy}
\item{Exoplanet detection in the 21st century}
\item{Fundamental limits to knowledge on exoplanets}
\end{itemize}
