\section{Introduction }
%"Don't you just hate it when you travel 1,200 light years to a planet scientists have assured you is "Earthlike," and you get there, and there's, like, NO ATMOSPHERE?!!" -- Martin BG, Potomac, MD



\section{Fundamental Techniques} 
In this chapter we will focus on exoplanet atmosphere characterization using the combined light from the planet and its host star. In contrast to direct imaging, which seeks to mask the stellar flux, the combined light approach capitalizes on the star as a constant reference point. As the planet moves through its orbit, it absorbs, re-emits, and reflects light from its host star. These planetary signals can be measured differentially relative to the baseline stellar flux.

\subsection{Transit Spectroscopy}
The most widely used combined-light technique is transmission spectroscopy. For this method, the planet is observed in transit as it passes in front of its host. The resulting time series of brightness measurements is known as the transit light curve. During the transit, the planet blocks a small fraction of the stellar flux equal to the sky-projected area of the planet relative to the area of the host star (as illustrated in Figure FIXME). We refer to this fraction as the \hbindex{transit depth}, $\delta = (R_p/R_s)^2$. 

The key idea behind transmission spectroscopy is that the apparent size of the planet is not actually a single value: rather, it depends on the wavelength of light used for the observation.  At wavelengths where the atmosphere is relatively more opaque due to absorption by atoms or molecules, the planet blocks slightly more stellar flux.
This change in transit depth with wavelength is the \hbindex{transmission spectrum}, so named because it due to transmission of stellar flux on the slant path through the planet's atmosphere.

A complete model of the transmission spectrum requires radiative transfer calculation for light on the slant path through the planet's atmosphere \citep{seager00}, a computationally intensive task. However, we can make a rough prediction of the size of features in the transmission spectrum based on the atmospheric \hbindex{scale height} $H$. The scale height is the change in altitude over which the pressure drops by a factor of $e$. Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, $H$ is: 

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{K_bT_{eq}}{\mu g}
\end{equation}
where $K_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{eq}$ is the planet's \hbindex{equilibrium temperature}, $\mu$ is the mean molecular mass, and $g$ is the surface gravity (FIXME). 

The amplitude of spectral features in transmission is then:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\lambda &=& \frac{(R_p + nH)^2}{R_s^2} - \frac{R_p^2}{R_s^2}\\
 & \approx & 2R_pH/R_s^2
\end{eqnarray} 
where $n$ is the number of scale heights crossed at wavelengths with high opacity. At low resolution (where individual spectral lines are not resolved), $n$ is typically around two for cloud-free atmospheres \citep{stevenson16}. 

It should be emphasized how miniscule these variations in transit depth are. Even for the best case scenario -- a hot, hydrogen-rich atmosphere with low surface gravity -- the amplitude of features is just $\delta_\lambda \sim0.1\%$ \citep[e.g. WASP 121-b;][]{evans16}. For Earth-like planets, the expected amplitude is two to three orders of magnitude smaller, depending on host star size. Transmission spectrum measurements therefore require extraordinary care and investment of telescope resources, as discussed in FIXME.

\subsection{Occultation Spectroscopy}
A close cousin of the transit spectroscopy method is \hbindex{occultation spectroscopy}, which measures thermal emission and reflection from the planet. Rather than observing the planet during transit, it is observed at secondary eclipse, when it passes behind the host star. The eclipse provides a baseline measurement of the stellar flux alone. When the planet rotates back into view, any increase in brightness can be attributed to the planet's thermal emission and reflected light.

For the short-period planets that have been studied so far, the dominant source of thermal emission is re-radiation of incident stellar flux (rather than latent heat of formation, as seen for directly imaged planets). Thus the typical size of the emission signal can be predicted from the planet's equilibrium temperature:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:fpfs}
\frac{F_p}{F_s} = \frac{B(\lambda, T_{eq})}{B(\lambda, T_s)}\left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $F_p/F_s$ is the planet-to-star flux ratio, $B(\lambda, T)$ is the blackbody spectral radiance at temperature $T$, and $R_p/R_s$ is the planet-to-star radius ratio. Since the planet is cooler than the star, the flux ratio is larger at longer wavelengths. For example, the planet-to-star flux for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is just 50 parts per million at 1 $\mu$m, but increases to over 1000 ppm at 4.5 $\mu$m \citep{line16}.

Equation \ref{eqn:fpfs} is a good first order approximation of the planet signal, but as with transmission spectroscopy, more complex features arise in the spectrum due to the atmosphere's changing opacity with wavelength. The emitted light comes from the photosphere of the planet, where the optical depth is of order unity.  As opacity increases, so does the altitude of the photosphere.  Therefore, since temperature changes with altitude, the observed atmosphere may be above or below $T_{eq}$, depending on the wavelength of the measurement. 

%A useful way to describe the temperature of the photosphere is the \hbindex{brightness temperature}: the temperature a blackbody needed to replicate the observed spectral intensity at a given wavelength.

At short wavelengths, reflected light from the planet may also be detectable. It is convenient to quantify the amount of reflected light in terms of a ``perfect" mirror: a flat, reflecting disk with the same cross-sectional area as the planet. The ratio of reflected light from the fully illuminated planet, relative to reflection by a perfect mirror, is the geometric albedo $A_g$. The total reflected light signal is:

\begin{equation}
F_{reflect} = A_g(R_p/a)^2 I(\alpha). FIXME
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis.

\runinhead{Phase Curves}
Short-period planets that are tidally locked to their host stars pose a unique opportunity for thermal emission and reflected light measurements. The rotation period for these planets is known (equal to their orbital period), so over the course of one complete orbit all longitudes are visible in turn. A \hbindex{phase curve} observation consists of continuous time series photometry or spectroscopy of a planet over its orbit, using the stellar flux at secondary eclipse as a baseline. These observations are powerful in that they probe atmospheric physics and chemistry over a wider geographic region than transits or eclipses alone; however, they are challenging from a practical standpoint because they require long stares at a single object, as we discuss in FIXME. %In principle it is possible to apply this technique to longer period planets that are not tidally locked; however, in addition to the feasibility challenge the interpretation is also problematic. 

\runinhead{Eclipse Mapping}
All of the occultation spectroscopy techniques described above rely on a hemisphere average of the planet's reflected or emitted light. To glean additional spatial information, one can use the \hbindex{eclipse mapping} method, which relies on precise observations of secondary eclipse ingress and egress.  During these intervals, the hemisphere of the planet is partially eclipsed by the star, allowing the observer to pinpoint the brightness of a smaller region and thus map the brightness distribution in detail. In particular, for planets with a nonzero impact parameter, the eclipse mapping technique is sensitive to changes in brightness with latitude (as higher latitudes are first to enter and exit eclipse). FIXME cite rauscher 07.
% This approach is based on the fact that planets are not uniformly bright. In the case of a hot gas giant, the hottest part of the atmosphere may be offset from the substellar point due to atmospheric circulation. For a terrestrial planet, continents and oceans with varying reflectivity may be present. 

\section{Observing Facilities}
Detecting the tiny signals from exoplanet atmospheres is a formidable challenge. Even for the most favorable systems, the amplitude of spectral features is of order a tenth of a percent. Pushing to this level of precision requires many photons (and thus large telescopes) as well as a stable observing environment (ideally in space).  In this section, we summarize the observing facilities that are best suited to this task (current as of January 2017).

\subsection{Space-Based}
\runinhead{Hubble Space Telescope}
The preeminent facility for exoplanet atmosphere characterization is the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} (\HST).
\HST\ offers three main advantages in observing exoplanets. It is (obviously) in space, so free from atmospheric turbulence that causes time-correlated noise in transit light curves. In addition, it gives access to wavelength regions that are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere (ultra-violet and water absorption bands).  Finally, its relatively large aperture (2.7 m) enables the collection of enough flux to push down the photon noise and reveal small signals.

There are two instruments on \HST\ commonly used for atmosphere characterization. One is the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), \HST's newest detector (installed in the last servicing mission in 2009). WFC3 is usually employed in its near-infrared spectroscopy mode, which provides low resolution (R=FIXME) spectroscopy from $0.8 - 1.7$ $\mu$m. This wavelength range covers strong absorption bands from water. It also sensitive to methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.

A major innovation in observing strategy for WFC3 was the implementation of ``spatial scanning" mode, which slews the telescope in the spatial direction during an exposure \citep[first used by][]{deming13}. This mode spreads the flux over more pixels, averaging over variations in individual pixel sensitvity. It also enables longer exposures of bright targets without saturating the detector, which improves the duty cycle of the observations by a factor of FIXME.

The other instrument frequently used for exoplanet observations is the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), a low-resolution UV/optical instrument. Though  
%fringing/cosmic rays

Past \HST\ observations used the NICMOS instrument, which is no longer available 
These results \citep{tinetti07, swain08} have been reanalyzed over time as data analysis techniques have grown more sophisticated \citep{gibson11}

The biggest downside to using \HST\ for exoplanets is that it cannot perform continuous observations. The telescope orbits the Earth every 96 minutes, so for roughly half that time (during Earth occultation) observations are interrupted. 

\runinhead{Spitzer Space Telescope}
In addition to \HST, the other space-based observing facility is \Spitzer, an 85 cm telescope launched in 2003. It was originally built to provide infrared spectroscopy from 3 - 160 $\mu$m.  In 2009, \Spitzer\ ran out of coolant and began its Warm Mission, which provides broadband photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m.  Most exoplanet observations have taken place during the Warm Mission, since relatively few planets were known prior to 2009!

Because of its smaller aperture, \Spitzer\ light curves are lower precision than \HST observations - FIXME give example. \Spitzer's unique strength is its long wavelength coverage, where planet-to-star flux ratios are higher. It is therefore often used for thermal emission measurements. \Spitzer\ also provides continuous observing capability thanks to its heliocentric orbit, and has led the way in observations of thermal phase curves, as we discuss in Section FIXME. 

%Intrapixel effect

\subsection{Ground-Based}
The Earth's atmosphere is an impediment to measuring precise light curves because its transparency changes with time.  As a target moves through the sky, line-of-sight properties such as the airmass, precipitable water vapor, and cloud coverage will vary, introducing systematic bias in the light curve that may be orders of magnitude larger than the signal from the planet. Despite this challenge, there are several inventive strategies that have made it possible to characterize exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. 

\runinhead{Photometry and Multi-Object Spectrographs}
One approach is to use comparison stars to correct for systematic trends in the target light curve. For photometry, this is a straightforward process: in addition to the target, several nearby stars are observed in the same field of view. The path of their flux traverses similar parts of the Earth's atmosphere, so their light curves exhibit close-to-identical systematic trends as the target. The target light curve can then be divided by the sum of the comparison star light curves to remove systematics. 

The same principle applies to spectroscopic observations, but requires a more specialized approach.  Spectrographs usually image the target through a slit prior to dispersing the light, in order to block out contamination from the sky background and any nearby stars. However, the slits are typically narrower than the seeing disk of the target star, and some fraction of flux -- highly dependent on the seeing -- is outside the slit.  To avoid these slit losses, one can use a multi-object spectrograph with a custom-made mask that has wide slits ($>10''$), a technique developed by \cite{bean10}. This method produces close to space-telescope quality precision \citep[e.g.][]{}.  There are several multi-object spectrographs available with a custom slit mask option, including Magellan/LDSS3c, Gemini/GMOS, Keck/, FIXME.  

\runinhead{High Resolution Spectrographs}
Another creative ground-based technique uses high resolution spectroscopy to measure the planet's transmission, emission, or reflection spectrum.  The underlying idea, first described by \citep{FIXME}, is that the spectrum of the planet's atmosphere is Doppler shifted due to its orbital motion. This Doppler shift separates the planet spectrum from both the host star spectrum and telluric absorption in the Earth's atmosphere. For reference, the hot Jupiter HD 209458b has an orbital velocity of $140\pm10$ km sec$^-1$ \citep{snellen10}, corresponding to a wavelength shift of $5\times10^{-4}\times \lambda$.  

The strength of the planet's individual Doppler-shifted spectral lines is too weak to detect with current instrumentation. However, the spectrum can be cross-correlated with a template, thereby harnessing the power of many lines.  The correlation strength is highest when the template is Doppler shifted to the planet's rest frame and matches its chemical composition.

The most widely used instrument for this technique is VLT/CRIRES, which provides $R=10^5$ spectroscopy from $1-5.3\,\mu$m using a $0.2"$ slit (FIXME).  The near-infrared wavelength range is ideal because it covers many (FIXME) molecular lines. An additional advantage is that the VLT has adaptive optics capability to increase the SNR of the spectra.  The technique has also been tested with a few other platforms, including Keck/NIRSPEC and HARPS \citep{lockwood14, martins15}. 

\section{Best Practices for Achieving Precise and Accurate Measurements}

\subsection{Observational Design}
The basic format for observing transiting planets is time series spectroscopy. 

designing a successful observation is in some ways more of an art than a science. We summarize here a few general thoughts based on collective wisdom.

\subsection{Data Reduction}

\subsection{Light Curve Fitting}
The reduced data consist of a time series of brightness measurements (either a ``white" light curve summed up over the entire bandpass, or spectroscopic light curves created by binning the spectrum into channels).  The most general model for the data is:

F(t) = S(t) \times T(t) \times E(t) \times \phi(t)

where $S(t)$ is the systematics model (e.g., a normalization constant or a linear trend with time), $T(t)$ is the transit model, $E(t)$ is the eclipse, and $\phi(t)$ is the phase variation from reflected and emitted light. In cases where only a transit or eclipse is observed, some of the terms can be neglected.

The transit is the most computationally challenging component to model because the star is not uniformly bright. \cite{mandel02} and \cite{gimenez06} calculated analytic solutions for the transit light curve for a range of stellar brightness profiles,  which are implemented in a number of publicly available software packages, including JKTEBOP, TAP, ExoFast, PyTransit, and BATMAN \citep{southworth04, gazak12, eastman13, parviainen15, kreidberg15}. For the case of eclipses, the same models can be used, but with the stellar brightness fixed at a constant value.

Phase curves have no unique model solution. One approach is to fit a sinusoid (with harmonics). Orange slice model.

\subsection{Sources of Error}

\runinhead{Photon Noise}
Photon noise is the fundamental limitation for atmosphere studies. Even assuming a perfect detector and perfect observing conditions, the measured light curve will still exhibit white Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of photons collected per exposure. (For a derivation see FIXME.) 

The photon limit is a major obstacle: it prevents us from characterizing planets around all but the very brightest stars.  The best targets typically have H mag $< 10$ (or V $< 10$ for optical observations).  
%Most spectral features are of order 100 ppm, requiring $N \sim 10^8$ photons \emph{per spectral bin} to detect. 

In addition to photon noise, there are many additional sources of error. In this rest of this section we outline what they are and how to mitigate them. 

\runinhead{Instrument Systematics}
The ideal instrument would record every incident photon. Current detectors have come a long way in achieving this goal, but they aren't perfect.

\section{Major Results from Atmosphere Studies}

\subsection{Chemical Composition}
%One of the biggest strengths of atmosphere characterization is that it can reveal the planet's chemical composition. There are a few basic 
Before jumping into observational results, here is a brief summary of what chemical species we might expect to find.  We know from the planets of the Solar System that a wide range of chemical compositions are possible. However, we can make some educated guesses about basic atmospheric constituents based on the building blocks of planet formation.

Gas giants are expected to have atmospheres rich in hydrogen and helium accreted from the protoplanetary disk.  Some metals are accreted in gas form along with the H/He, and the atmosphere can be further metal-enriched by planetesimal impacts (FIXME). The most abundant metals are carbon and oxygen \citep{anders89}.  At the temperatures and pressures in planetary atmospheres, these elements combine into molecules: water (H$_2$O), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$).  (Molecular oxygen reacts quickly with neutral hydrogen and is not expected to be seen in abundance.) In addition to these very abundant molecules, a few trace species with large absorption cross-sections may also be seen. These include the alkali metals (particularly sodium, Na) and titanium and vanadium oxides (TiO and VO).  

The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are less predictable. Hydrogen and helium escape easily from small rocky worlds, so their atmospheres are more likely due to outgassing from the planet interior. Their compositions may evolve significantly due to geologic cycling -- or the presence of life (FIXME). 
%Observations of planet masses and radii have shown a turning point in bulk composition from gaseous to rocky at around 1.6 Earth radii \citep{weiss14, rogers15}. 
%These smaller rocky worlds are likely to have secondary atmospheres, outga

\runinhead{Detections}
Much of exoplanet atmosphere characterization to date has focused on basic inventory: what atoms and molecules are present?  Several absorbers have been unambiguously identified so far, including H$_2$O, CO, Na, FIXME. 

The most common is H$_2$O detections from \HST/WFC3.

There is also evidence for CO and CO$_2$ from \Spitzer\ photometry. However, the \Spitzer\ bandpasses are about $1\,\mu$m wide, and cover spectral features from multiple different absorbing species (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O). It is possible to

\subsection{Aerosols}
Aerosols -- an umbrella term for clouds and hazes -- are ubiquitous in the Solar System and are proving to be common in exoplanets too. Evidence for aerosols shows up in both transmission and reflection spectra.

Transmission spectra are especially sensitive to the presence of clouds and hazes due to the slant viewing geometry during transit (FIXME: fig?) \citep{fortney05}. The optical path of photons is long, so even trace species have large optical depth relative to a face-on view.
