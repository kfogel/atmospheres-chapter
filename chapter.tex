This template was adapted from Springer's template `author.tex' for contributed books, using the style svmult.cls (distributed together with this template). \\ Each chapter should be preceded by an abstract (10--15 lines long) that summarizes the content. The abstract will appear \textit{online} at \url{www.SpringerLink.com} and at ADS and be available with unrestricted access.

\section{Introduction }
%"Don't you just hate it when you travel 1,200 light years to a planet scientists have assured you is "Earthlike," and you get there, and there's, like, NO ATMOSPHERE?!!" -- Martin BG, Potomac, MD



\section{Techniques} 
In this chapter we will focus on exoplanet atmosphere characterization using the combined light from the planet and its host star. In contrast to direct imaging, which seeks to mask the stellar flux, the combined light approach capitalizes on the star as a constant reference point. 

%As the planet moves through its orbit, it can absorb
%Changes in the sum total brightness with time can be traced to emission, reflection, or absorption by the planet's atmosphere.

\subsection{Transit Spectroscopy}
The most widely used combined-light technique is transmission spectroscopy. For this method, the planet is observed in transit as it passes in front of its host. During a transit, the planet blocks a small fraction of the stellar flux equal to the sky-projected area of the planet relative to the area of the host star. We refer to this fraction as the \hbindex{transit depth}, $\delta = (R_p/R_s)^2$.

The key idea behind transmission spectroscopy is that the apparent size of the planet is not actually a single value: rather, it depends on the wavelength of light used for the observation.  At wavelengths where the atmosphere is relatively more opaque due to absorption by atoms, molecules, or condensates, the planet blocks slightly more stellar flux.
This change in transit depth with wavelength is the \hbindex{transmission spectrum}, so named because it due to transmission of stellar flux on the slant path through the planet's atmosphere.


Modeling the transmission spectrum requires radiative transfer calculation for light on the slant path through the planet's atmosphere. 

The size of features in the transmission spectrum is set by the \hbindex{scale height} $H$. The scale height is the change in altitude over which the atmospheric pressure drops by a factor of $e$, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We can express $H$ in terms of the planet's physical properties:  

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{K_bT_{eq}}{\mu g}
\end{equation}
where $K_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{eq}$ is the planet's \hbindex{equilibrium temperature}, $\mu$ is the mean molecular mass, and $g$ is the surface gravity (FIXME). 

Assuming the planet's radius is larger by $n$ scale heights at wavelengths with high opacity, the amplitude of features in the spectrum is given by

\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\lambda &=& \frac{(R_p + nH)^2}{R_s^2} - \frac{R_p^2}{R_s^2}\\
 & \approx & 2R_pH/R_s^2.
\end{eqnarray} 
Observations of hot Jupiters have typically had $n\approx2$ \citep{stevenson16}. 

It should be emphasized how miniscule these variations in transit depth are. Even for the best case scenario -- a hot, hydrogen-rich atmosphere with low surface gravity -- the amplitude of features is just $\delta_\lambda \sim0.1\%$ \citep[e.g. WASP 121-b;][]{evans16}. For Earth-like planets, the expected amplitude is two to three orders of magnitude smaller, depending on host star size. Transmission spectrum measurements therefore require extraordinary care and investment of telescope resources, as discussed in FIXME.

\subsection{Occultation Spectroscopy}
A close cousin of the transit spectroscopy method is \hbindex{occultation spectroscopy}, which measures thermal emission and reflection from the planet. Rather than observing the planet during transit, it is observed at secondary eclipse, when it passes behind the host star. The eclipse provides a baseline measurement of the stellar flux alone. When the planet rotates back into view, any increase in brightness can be attributed to the planet's thermal emission and reflected light.

For the short-period planets that have been studied so far, the dominant source of thermal emission is re-radiation of incident stellar flux (rather than latent heat of formation, as seen for directly imaged planets). Thus the typical size of the emission signal can be predicted from the planet's equilibrium temperature:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:fpfs}
\frac{F_p}{F_s} = \frac{B(\lambda, T_{eq})}{B(\lambda, T_s)}\left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $F_p/F_s$ is the planet-to-star flux ratio, $B(\lambda, T)$ is the blackbody spectral radiance at temperature $T$, and $R_p/R_s$ is the planet-to-star radius ratio. Since the planet is cooler than the star, the flux ratio is larger at longer wavelengths. For example, the planet-to-star flux for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is just 50 parts per million at 1 $\mu$m, but increases to over 1000 ppm at 4.5 $\mu$m \citep{line16}.

Equation \ref{eqn:fpfs} is a good first order approximation of the planet signal, but as with transmission spectroscopy, more complex features arise in the spectrum due to the atmosphere's changing opacity with wavelength. The emitted light comes from the photosphere of the planet, where the optical depth is unity.  As opacity increases, so does the altitude of the photosphere.  Therefore, since temperature changes with altitude, the observed atmosphere may be above or below $T_{eq}$, depending on the wavelength of the measurement. 

%A useful way to describe the temperature of the photosphere is the \hbindex{brightness temperature}: the temperature a blackbody needed to replicate the observed spectral intensity at a given wavelength.

At short wavelengths, reflected light from the planet may also be detectable. It is convenient to quantify the amount of reflected light in terms of a ``perfect" mirror: a flat, reflecting disk with the same cross-sectional area as the planet. The ratio of reflected light from the fully illuminated planet, relative to reflection by a perfect mirror, is the geometric albedo $A_g$. The total reflected light signal is then:

\begin{equation}
F_{reflect} = A_g(R_p/a)^2 I(\alpha). FIXME
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis.

\runinhead{Phase Curves}
Short-period planets that are tidally locked to their host stars pose a unique opportunity for thermal emission and reflected light measurements. The rotation period for these planets is known (equal to their orbital period), so over the course of one complete orbit all longitudes are visible in turn. A \hbindex{phase curve} observation consists of continuous time series photometry or spectroscopy of a planet over its orbit, using the stellar flux at secondary eclipse as a baseline. These observations are powerful in that they probe atmospheric physics and chemistry over a wider geographic region than transits or eclipses alone; however, they are challenging from a practical standpoint because they require long stares at a single object, as we discuss in FIXME. %In principle it is possible to apply this technique to longer period planets that are not tidally locked; however, in addition to the feasibility challenge the interpretation is also problematic. 

\runinhead{Eclipse Mapping}
All of the occultation spectroscopy techniques described above rely on a hemisphere average of the planet's reflected or emitted light. To glean additional spatial information, one can use the \hbindex{eclipse mapping} method, which relies on precise observations of secondary eclipse ingress and egress.  During these intervals, the hemisphere of the planet is partially eclipsed by the star, allowing the observer to pinpoint the brightness of a smaller region and thus map the brightness distribution in detail. In particular, for planets with a nonzero impact parameter, the eclipse mapping technique is sensitive to changes in brightness with latitude (as higher latitudes are first to enter and exit eclipse).
% This approach is based on the fact that planets are not uniformly bright. In the case of a hot gas giant, the hottest part of the atmosphere may be offset from the substellar point due to atmospheric circulation. For a terrestrial planet, continents and oceans with varying reflectivity may be present.
